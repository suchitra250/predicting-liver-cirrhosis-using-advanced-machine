Here's a potential outline for a PPT on "Liver Cirrhosis Detection/Prediction using Advanced Machine Learning":

*Slide 1: Introduction*

- Title: Liver Cirrhosis Detection/Prediction using Advanced Machine Learning
- Subtitle: A Novel Approach for Early Diagnosis and Treatment
- Image: Liver anatomy or cirrhosis illustration

*Slide 2: Problem Statement*

- Liver cirrhosis: A leading cause of liver-related deaths worldwide
- Current diagnosis methods: Invasive, expensive, and often late-stage
- Machine learning potential: Early detection, non-invasive, and cost-effective

*Slide 3: Objectives*

- Develop a machine learning model for liver cirrhosis detection/prediction
- Evaluate model performance using metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity)
- Explore potential applications in clinical practice

*Slide 4: Methodology*

- Dataset: Description (source, features, size)
- Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization
- Model selection: Type (e.g., classification, regression), algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, CNN)
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ROC-AUC

*Slide 5: Feature Selection*

- Relevant features: Demographics, lab results, medical history, imaging data
- Feature selection methods: Correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination

*Slide 6: Model Performance*

- Results: Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ROC-AUC curves
- Comparison: Different models, feature sets

*Slide 7: Discussion*

- Implications: Early detection, personalized medicine, clinical decision support
- Limitations: Data quality, model interpretability
- Future directions: Multi-modal fusion, transfer learning

*Slide 8: Conclusion*

- Summary: Key findings, contributions
- Future work: Potential applications, extensions

*Slide 9: References*

- List sources used in the project

You can add more slides or elaborate on these points based on your specific project. Some potential images to include:

- Liver anatomy
- Cirrhosis illustrations
- Machine learning/ AI-related graphics
- ROC-AUC curves
- Heatmaps or feature importance plots
